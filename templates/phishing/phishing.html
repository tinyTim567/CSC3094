            <p>
                Phishing is a type of scam where an attacker attempts to deceive a user into giving away personal
                information, such as passwords or bank details, using scam emails, text messages or phone calls.
            </p>
            <p>
                Phishing is one of the main methods used to commit fraud, so it's important to know how to recognise
                scam
                messages.
