                It’s important to have strong passwords for your important online accounts, such as your email, banking
                and
                social media. It’s easy to create strong, easy-to-remember passwords using the <b>three random words
                rule</b>.

                The longer a password is, the harder it is for cybercriminals to crack. A good way to make a strong
                password
                is to combine <b>three random words</b> to create a password (for example <i>“calendargrapesmug”</i>).
                This
                method is recommended as it allows you to create unique, easy-to-remember passwords.

            <h1>Aren’t passwords supposed to be very complex?</h1>
            <p>The traditional advice has been to create complex passwords; however, the National Cyber Security Centre
                now recommend three random words instead.</p>

                Longstanding advice around making your passwords very complex (which suggests we should create
                passwords
                full of random characters, symbols and numbers) is not helpful. This is because most of us have lots of
                passwords, and memorising lots of complex passwords is almost impossible.
                <br>
                <br>
                Passwords generated from three random words is a good way to create unique passwords that are ‘long
                enough'
                and ‘strong enough’ for most purposes, but which can also be remembered much more easily. If you want to
                write your password down, that’s also OK, provided you keep it somewhere safe.
