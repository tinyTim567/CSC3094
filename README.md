# Educating the General Public About Cyber Threats

> This repository is part of **CSC3094 Major Project and Dissertation in Computer Science**.

## About

This project is an interactive website (made with Python Flask) that teaches basic cybersecurity skills to the general
public in a simplified,
easy-to-understand way.

## Project Overview

### Motivation

With the ever-increasing reliance on digital platforms for large parts of our daily lives, there is a growing need for
people to have the digital skills needed to use these systems safely while avoiding harmful material online, such as
phishing and scam emails. This can be seen in official statistics on scams and fraud:

- **46%** of adult internet users have been drawn into engaging in an online scam¹
- **25%** increase in fraud offences in 2022 compared to 2020²
- **61%** of fraud incidents in 2022 were cyber related²

Current guidance available online about cyber threats often includes technical language that is difficult for people
with non-technical backgrounds t understand. Guidance is often textual and includes few examples of the threats
themselves. The majority of sites do not include interactive elements in their content.

### Aim

To develop an interactive online platform for teaching members of the public about various cyber threats and how to
protect themselves against them.

### Objectives

1) Design and implement a website providing information about cyber threats.
2) Implement interactive elements into each resource on the website.
3) Collect qualitative data from users using a questionnaire to provide feedback about the design of the website.
4) Evaluate the effectiveness of the website for improving people's knowledge of cyber threats and how to avoid them.
